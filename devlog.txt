- assets: grass and snow block
- chunk surface generation from perlin noise with snow instead of grass above height threshold
03/03/23 [3h]
- world BP: all settings for terrain generation and noise setup logic moved here, spawns initial chunk 
* thanks to variable name typo, most time spent learning how to debug blueprints
04/03/23 [8h]
- chunk initializing voxels with block IDs, instancing only top block of terrain
- hard refactoring of world and chunk BPs
* noise now working if set-up in construction script (race condition?)
05/03/23 [6h]
- working on dynamic chunk loading
* trying to make publisher and listeners for entering chunk event 

06/03/23 [7h]
- finishing dynamic chunk loading
- structure holding info about loaded chunks removed, chunks beyond load distance "symmetrically" spawn new chunks before they are destroyed (one for one)
* box collision bugs, learning how collision works

next: add more blocks, removing and adding blocks
